                    <h3>Dragon Habits</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>The behaviors and habits of dragons vary wildly from species to species, yet they all have a few things in common. It wasn't until scholars went in search of dragons to find out more about them did we start to understand them. </li>
                         <li>Most dragons hoard some type of material, but they do not use this as a bed.</li>
                         <li>Some species of dragons hibernate in the winter</li>
                         <li>Dragons stay with their parents until the age of four to six, where they then head off in search of territory of their own</li>
                         <li>Forest dragons that are bonded with a human like to play hide and seek</li>
                         <li>Aggressive dragons will flare their wings to make them more imposing</li>
                         <li>Dragons that are about to attack will rarely breath fire first, opting to get in close</li>
                         <li>Dragons without wings are more skittish when in the open plain</li>
                         <li>Forest dragons will often raise their young within the trees to teach them how to balance</li>
                         <li>Juveniles tend to be more rambunctious and aggressive than adults and older dragons</li>
                         <li>The horns of dragons can signify how old they are</li>
                         <li>Scholars have found that dragons with bright colors are more active in the day </li>
                    </ul>

                         <li>Parents will violently attack trespassers that invade their home</li>
                         <li>Dragons don't get their ability to breath fire until they are twenty years old</li>
